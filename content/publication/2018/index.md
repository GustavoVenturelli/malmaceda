abstract: This dissertation seeks to map the network of artists, intellectuals and events responsible, in the     1970s, for introducing discussions and languages of contemporary art in the Southern axis of Brazil. As such, it  focuses on the region's largest urban centers, the capitals Curitiba (PR) and Porto Alegre (RS), whose artistic  fields are better structured and longer-lived. Especially through archival research and interviews, the sociocultural and political specificities that shaped the conditions for the emergence of a field of artistic freedom, of rupture from canons, are analyzed - from the so-called "*anos de chumbo*", of dictatorial regime to the beginning of redemocratization. In the case studies, greater attention is given to collective and experimental actions linked to conceptualisms in visual arts - which sought to break from regionalist tradition and discourses, expanding the state boundaries - conceived by artists involved with the countercultural thinking, in vogue since the early 1960.
