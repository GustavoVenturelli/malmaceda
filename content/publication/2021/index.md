abstract: In this article I analyze the film and the script of Bacurau (2019), directed by Kléber
  Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles. The work is understood from the perspective of
  weird fiction for the conjunction between the elements of futurity of the narrative and
  the social conflicts of Brazil's countryside, anchored in a historical reality. Mixing
  cinematographic genres in a film that goes from Cangaço Cinema to Gore, Bacurau
  confronts us with a dystopia about the proliferation of surveillance and control
  technologies and, specially, about the proliferation of political systems of death.
