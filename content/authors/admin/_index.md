[Luise Malmaceda](https://laic.columbia.edu/content/luise-malmaceda) is a Ph.D. student in [Latin American and Iberian Cultures](https://laic.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. She holds a B.A. in Visual Arts from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and a M.A. in Aesthetics and Art History from the Universidade de São Paulo. Her research interests include 20th century avant-garde art, music, cinema and poetry, with emphasis on underground and countercultural movements of the 1960s; experimental and conceptual practices in visual arts and their challenges of institutionalization; and Brazilian cultural resistance to the civil-military dictatorship (1964-1985).

Before coming to Columbia, she worked as an associate curator at Instituto Tomie Ohtake (São Paulo) from 2016 to 2020, creating curatorial projects, researching and writing for exhibitions and catalogues, and lecturing courses on modern and contemporary art history. She was also a jury member of the award EDP nas Artes (2018), editor of Harper's Bazaar Art magazine (2015), and art educator and researcher at Fundação Vera Chaves Barcellos (2012) and Fundação Iberê Camargo (2010).
